# FlappyBirdClone
Python-based Flappy Bird clone, with graphics implementation using Pygame. Pillars will come at you at a certain speed, whilst you have to fight against gravity to stay up and fly through gaps between the pillars. We will use a timer to spawn pillars that have a gap, and will implement a bird (player) that dodges between the pillars. We will draw the graphics and then implement them into our game by using Pygame, and will then create a background that makes it look like the bird is moving, rather than the pillars.

## How to Run The Project
[Class Diagram]()
### Source Code
[Download Link](https://github.com/9704244/FlappyBirdClone/tree/main/src/FlappyBirdClone)
### Instructions:
This project requires the use of the 'cd' command (see linked site) or an integrated development environment (IDE) to run. Regardless of which method you use, you will need to install python, and the game-making based attatchment to python, pygame.

To run this project with the 'cd' command, you will need to do the following:

1. Install python, pygame, and this github repository to your computer
2. Open up command prompt (if you're on windows) or terminal (if you're on an Apple device)
3. Use the 'cd' command to navigate your way to the source code:
   * Downloads\FlappyBirdClone-main\FlappyBirdClone-main\src\FlappyBirdClone (This may slightly differ depending on you're computer or where you have stored the Github Repository, but can still be used as a general guide to the 'FlappyBirdClone folder, AKA the source code)
4. Use the 'python3 main.py' command to run the application
5. If you wish to restart, in command prompt or terminal use the key combination 'ctrl + z', and then redo step 4
6. To exit entirely, simply hit the exit button
