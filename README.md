# FlappyBirdClone
Python-based Flappy Bird clone, with graphics implementation using Pygame. Pillars will come at you at a certain speed, whilst you have to fight against gravity to stay up and fly through gaps between the pillars. We will use a timer to spawn pillars that have a gap, and will implement a bird (player) that dodges between the pillars. We will draw the graphics and then implement them into our game by using Pygame, and will then create a background that makes it look like the bird is moving, rather than the pillars.
